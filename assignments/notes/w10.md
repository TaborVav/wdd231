====== What is user experience? ===
    User experience refers to how a user feels when interacting with a system, product, or service. It encompasses everything from ease of use and accessibility to design aesthetics and emotional response. Good UX design ensures that a userâ€™s interaction is efficient, enjoyable, and meaningful.

====== What role does performance play in the UX of my site? ===
    Website performance, such as load times and responsiveness, is critical to UX. Slow sites frustrate users and often lead to higher bounce rates. Optimizing images, reducing server response times, and using efficient code are common ways to improve performance.

====== What role does accessibility play in the UX of my site? ===
    Accessibility ensures that all users, including those with disabilities, can interact with your site. This includes screen reader support, keyboard navigation, sufficient color contrast, and semantic HTML. Accessibility is not just ethical but often legally required.

====== What role does security play in the UX of my site? ===
    Security affects UX by building trust with users. A secure website (HTTPS, secure forms, protection from XSS and CSRF attacks) reassures users their data is safe. Poor security can harm reputation and deter users.

====== What role does SEO play in the UX of my site? ===
    SEO and UX overlap. A well-structured, fast, and accessible site not only helps with search engine rankings but also provides a better experience for users. SEO best practices like proper headings, descriptive link text, and clean URLs benefit both search bots and users.

=== How can I improve the user experience of my website? ===
    - Conduct usability testing
    - Improve site speed
    - Simplify navigation

=== How can usability testing help me improve the user experience of my website? ===

    - Prioritize changes that will most positively impact UX
