========== Javascript Fetch ==========

-- What is Fetch in Javascript?
    In JavaScript, fetch() is a built-in function used to make HTTP requests and handle responses. It is part of the Fetch API, which provides a more modern and flexible way to interact with servers compared to older techniques like XMLHttpRequest.

    Features:
        Promise-based: Returns a promise that resolves to the Response object.
        Asynchronous: Non-blocking, allowing for responsive applications.
        Modern and Cleaner: Syntax is more readable and compact compared to XMLHttpRequest.
    
    Example Usage:
        // Sending a GET request
        fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
        .then(response => {
            if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
            }
            return response.json();  // Convert response to JSON
        })
        .then(data => console.log(data))  // Process the JSON data
        .catch(error => console.error('Fetch error:', error));

-- What does it mean to be asynchronous in Javascript?
    In JavaScript, being asynchronous means that certain operations can be performed without blocking the execution of other code. In other words, the program can continue running while waiting for a time-consuming task (like an HTTP request or file reading) to complete.
    
    Why Asynchronous?
        JavaScript runs on a single-threaded event loop. This means it can execute one task at a time. If a task takes a long time (like fetching data from a server), it can block the entire script, making the application unresponsive. Asynchronous programming allows such tasks to run in the background without stopping other operations.

-- What is a promise?
    A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises provide a cleaner, more readable way to handle asynchronous tasks compared to traditional callback functions.

-- How can I use promises with Fetch?
    Using Promises with the fetch() function in JavaScript is a common pattern for making HTTP requests. The fetch() function itself returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object when the request completes successfully.

    Basic Syntax:
        fetch(url, options)
            .then(response => response.json())   // Convert to JSON
            .then(data => console.log(data))     // Handle the parsed data
            .catch(error => console.error("Error:", error));  // Handle errors

-- How can I use Fetch to retrieve data from a JSON file?
    You can use the fetch() function in JavaScript to retrieve data from a local or remote JSON file. The process is straightforward because fetch() returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object.

    Step 1: Create a JSON File
        Assuming you have a local file named data.json with the following content:

        {
        "name": "Alice",
        "age": 30,
        "city": "New York"
        }

    Step 2: Fetch the JSON File
        fetch('./data.json')  // Relative path to the JSON file
        .then(response => {
            if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
            }
            return response.json();  // Parse the response as JSON
        })
        .then(data => console.log("Data from JSON file:", data))  // Handle parsed data
        .catch(error => console.error("Error fetching JSON file:", error));
    
    Expected Output:
        Data from JSON file: { name: "Alice", age: 30, city: "New York" }

    Step 3: Using Async/Await for Cleaner Code
        async function loadJson() {
        try {
            const response = await fetch('./data.json');
            if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`Error: ${response.status}`);
            const data = await response.json();
            console.log("Async/Await Data:", data);
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Failed to fetch JSON:", error);
        }
        }

        loadJson();

========== APIs (Application Programming Interface) ==========

-- What is an API?
    An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows one software application to interact with another. It acts as a bridge between different software systems, enabling them to communicate and exchange data seamlessly.

-- Why Use APIs?
    APIs are essential for building modern web applications and services because they:
        1. Enable Communication: Allow different systems to interact regardless of the underlying technology.
        2. Promote Reusability: Developers can leverage existing functionalities without reinventing the wheel.
        3. Increase Efficiency: Save time by utilizing pre-built methods or data.
        4. Integrate Services: Connect your app with third-party services like payment gateways, social media, or weather updates.

-- How Does an API Work?
    PIs typically follow a request-response model:

        1. Client Sends a Request: The client application (e.g., your web app) makes an HTTP request to the API endpoint.
        2. Server Processes the Request: The server interprets the request and performs the necessary actions (like fetching data).
        3. Server Sends a Response: The server returns the result, usually in a structured format like JSON or XML.

    Example: API Request and Response:
        Request:

        GET https://api.example.com/users/123
        Response:

        {
        "id": 123,
        "name": "Alice",
        "email": "alice@example.com"
        }

-- How could I use the national park service api to get information about Yellowstone national park?
    You can use the National Park Service (NPS) API to get information about Yellowstone National Park by making an HTTP request to the NPS API endpoint.

    Step 1: Get an API Key
        - Visit the NPS Developer Portal.
        - Sign up and obtain an API key. You will need it to authenticate your requests.

    Step 2: API Endpoint
        The basic format to get park information is:
        https://developer.nps.gov/api/v1/parks?parkCode=CODE&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY

    Step 3: Fetch Yellowstone Data
        Example using fetch(): 
            async function getYellowstoneInfo() {
            const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';  // Replace with your actual API key
            const url = `https://developer.nps.gov/api/v1/parks?parkCode=yell&api_key=${apiKey}`;

            try {
                const response = await fetch(url);
                if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`Error: ${response.status}`);
                const data = await response.json();
                const yellowstone = data.data[0];

                console.log("Park Name:", yellowstone.fullName);
                console.log("Description:", yellowstone.description);
                console.log("Directions:", yellowstone.directionsInfo);
                console.log("Website:", yellowstone.url);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error("Failed to fetch Yellowstone data:", error);
            }
            }

            getYellowstoneInfo();

        Sample output: 
            Park Name: Yellowstone National Park
            Description: First national park in the world known for geothermal features.
            Directions: Yellowstone has five entrance stations. Please check road conditions.
