1. What is a URL parameter?
    A URL parameter is a piece of data added to the end of a URL to pass information to a webpage. Itâ€™s usually found after a question mark (?) and written as a key-value pair.

    Example:
        https://example.com/page?name=Alex&age=25

            == In the above example ==
            - 'name' and 'age' are keys (parameter names)
            - Alex and 25 are the values
            - Multiple parameters are separated with an &

            == URL parameters are often used for ==
            Personalizing content (e.g., greeting a user by name)
            Tracking (e.g., utm_source in marketing links)
            Sending data between pages

2. How is a URL constructed?
    A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) has several parts:

    https://example.com:443/path/page.html?name=Alex#section2

    - 'https' is protocol
    - 'example.com' is the domain name (host)
    - '443' is the port (optional, usually hidden for HTTP/HTTPS)
    - '/path/page.html' is the path to a specific file or route
    - '?name=Alex' is the query string (URL parameters)
    - '#section2' is a fragment identifier (optional; for navigating to a section on the page)

3. How can I use a URL parameter to pass information to a webpage with JavaScript?
    Example:

    1. Accessing the parameter in JavaScript:
    If the URL is:
        https://example.com/?user=Tabor

    You can read the parameter in JS like this:
        const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
        const user = params.get("user");
        console.log(user); // Output: "Tabor"

    2. Using that value:
    You could use it to customize content, like greeting the user:
        const greeting = document.getElementById("greeting");
        if (user) {
        greeting.textContent = `Hello, ${user}!`;
        }
        
    And your HTML might include:
        <h1 id="greeting">Welcome!</h1>
