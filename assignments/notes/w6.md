====== Local Storage ======

- What is localStorage?

    * `localStorage` is a Web Storage API provided by the browser.
    * It allows you to store key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration time.
    * Data persists even after the browser is closed and reopened.

- How is it used?

    * Use `localStorage.setItem(key, value)` to store data.
    * Use `localStorage.getItem(key)` to retrieve data.
    * Use `localStorage.removeItem(key)` to delete specific data.
    * Use `localStorage.clear()` to remove all data.

- Example: Storing JavaScript Objects in localStorage

    ```javascript
    const user = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30
    };

    // Convert object to JSON string before storing
    localStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify(user));

    // Retrieve and parse the object
    const retrievedUser = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user"));
    console.log(retrievedUser.name); // Output: Alice
    ```

====== Forms and Accessibility ======

- Accessibility Concerns

* Inadequate labeling of form inputs.
* Poor keyboard navigation.
* Missing or improper use of ARIA roles.
* Inconsistent or low-contrast design.

- Using HTML to Address Accessibility
    * Use `<label>` with the `for` attribute matching the `id` of the input.
    * Use semantic HTML elements like `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, `<button>`, etc.
    * Include `aria-*` attributes where appropriate (e.g., `aria-required`, `aria-label`).
    * Use `tabindex` to control tab navigation order.

- Using CSS to Improve Accessibility
    * Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background.
    * Avoid using color alone to convey information.
    * Provide visual focus indicators for inputs and buttons (e.g., using `:focus` pseudo-class).
    * Use relative units (em, rem) for scalability.

====== Code Architecture: CSS `@import` ======

* The `@import` rule allows you to include one CSS file into another.
* Syntax: `@import url("styles.css");`
* Should be placed at the top of a CSS file before any rules.
* Can lead to performance issues due to additional HTTP requests.
* Better alternatives include using `<link>` in HTML or CSS preprocessors like SASS for modularity.

```css
/* styles.css */
@import url("reset.css");
@import url("typography.css");
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}
```
