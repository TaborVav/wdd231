- What is Progressive Enhancement? 
    Progressive Enhancement is a web design and development strategy that focuses on building a baseline, functional experience for all users, regardless of their browser capabilities or device constraints, and then adding advanced features for those with more capable browsers or devices.

    Key Principles of Progressive Enhancement:
        1. Core Content First:
            - Ensure the essential content and functionality of a website or app are accessible to all users, even on older browsers or slower connections.
            - Use clean, semantic HTML to provide a solid foundation.
        2. Separation of Concerns:
            - Structure with HTML (content),
            - Style with CSS (presentation),
            - Behavior with JavaScript (interactivity).
            - This separation allows each layer to enhance the previous one.
        3. Enhance, Don‚Äôt Rely:
            - JavaScript and CSS are used to enhance the user experience but are not required for core functionality.
            - This means the site should still work if CSS or JavaScript fails to load or is not supported.
        4. Graceful Enhancement:
            - After establishing the core experience, use feature detection (not browser detection) to layer on additional features for users with modern browsers.

- How can I apply it to a webpage to improve it‚Äôs compatibility?
    Applying Progressive Enhancement to a webpage involves layering your development process to prioritize content first, and then enhancing that experience for more capable browsers or devices. Here's a step-by-step approach you can follow to improve your webpage‚Äôs compatibility:

    1. Start with Semantic HTML (Core Content)
        - Use clean, semantic HTML5 to structure your content. This ensures that your site is accessible even in very old browsers or for users with assistive technologies.
    2. Add CSS for Enhanced Presentation
        - Use external stylesheets to apply responsive, accessible, and modern styling.
        - Use media queries for responsive design.
    Always ensure content remains readable and usable without CSS.
    3. Add JavaScript for Enhanced Interactivity
        - Use feature detection (via Modernizr or if ('querySelector' in document) style checks) instead of browser detection.
        - Use JavaScript to enhance (not replace) core functionality.
    4. Use ARIA and Accessibility Best Practices
        - Add ARIA roles and proper labeling to ensure screen readers and assistive devices can interpret your content properly.
    5. Provide Fallbacks for Media and Features
        - Use <noscript> for JavaScript fallbacks.
        - Use <picture> and srcset for image compatibility.
        - Include fallback fonts and color-safe themes.
    6. Test Across Browsers and Devices
        Test the page:
            With JavaScript disabled.
            On slow networks.
            In older browsers.
            On assistive technologies (like screen readers).

- What are social media meta tags in html?
    - Social media meta tags are snippets of HTML code (usually <meta> tags in the <head> section of a webpage) that control how your content appears when shared on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.

    - They allow you to define the title, description, image, and other preview info so your links look attractive and informative in feeds.

    Main Types of Social Media Meta Tags:
    1. Open Graph (OG) Tags ‚Äì Used by Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest, etc.
        <!-- Open Graph meta tags -->
        <meta property="og:title" content="Your Page Title Here" />
        <meta property="og:description" content="A brief description of your page content." />
        <meta property="og:image" content="https://example.com/image.jpg" />
        <meta property="og:url" content="https://example.com/your-page" />
        <meta property="og:type" content="website" />
        <meta property="og:site_name" content="Your Site Name" />
        üìù Tip: Always include og:title, og:description, and og:image for a good-looking preview.

    2. Twitter Cards ‚Äì Used by Twitter
        <!-- Twitter Card meta tags -->
        <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
        <meta name="twitter:title" content="Your Page Title Here" />
        <meta name="twitter:description" content="A short summary for Twitter." />
        <meta name="twitter:image" content="https://example.com/image.jpg" />
        <meta name="twitter:site" content="@YourTwitterHandle" />
        üìù Use "summary" for small image previews or "summary_large_image" for large image cards.
    3. Additional Tags for Rich Snippets (Optional)
        Some platforms also support Schema.org JSON-LD for enhanced search and social features, though it's more for search engines.

    - Why Use Social Media Meta Tags?
        Control how your content looks on social media.
        Increase click-through rate (CTR) with visually rich previews.
        Improve SEO indirectly by boosting shareability and engagement.

    Example: Complete Set in HTML

        <head>

        <meta property="og:title" content="My Awesome Webpage" />
        <meta property="og:description" content="This is an amazing webpage worth sharing." />
        <meta property="og:image" content="https://example.com/preview.jpg" />

        <meta name="twitter:title" content="My Awesome Webpage" />
        <meta name="twitter:description" content="This is an amazing webpage worth sharing." />
        <meta name="twitter:image" content="https://example.com/preview.jpg" />
