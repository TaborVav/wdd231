# Notes on Regular Expressions and Git Branching

## Regular Expressions

### What are regular expressions?
Regular expressions (regex) are sequences of characters that define search patterns. They are mainly used for string matching, searching, and replacing operations. Regex can be simple or complex and are useful for validating input, extracting data, and transforming text.

### What are some examples of using regular expressions?
- **Validate an email address:**  
  `/^[\w.-]+@[\w.-]+\.\w{2,}$/`
- **Find all instances of a word in text:**  
  `/\bword\b/g`
- **Replace multiple spaces with a single space:**  
  `/ +/g`
- **Match a date in yyyy-mm-dd format:**  
  `/^(19|20)\d\d[- /.](0[1-9]|1[012])[- /.](0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])$/`

### How can I make my own regular expressions?
1. **Identify the pattern you want to match** (e.g., digits, letters, specific formatting).
2. **Use regex syntax** to define the pattern:
   - `\d` for digits
   - `\w` for word characters
   - `.` for any character
   - `^` and `$` for start and end of line
   - `*`, `+`, `?`, `{}` for quantities
   - `[]` for character sets
   - `()` for groups
3. **Test your regex** using tools like [Regex101](https://regex101.com) or [RegexOne](https://regexone.com).
4. **Apply the regex** in your code or editor using search, replace, or validation functions.

## Git Branching

### What is a branch in Git?
A branch in Git is a lightweight, movable pointer to a commit. It allows developers to work on features, fixes, or experiments in isolation from the main (production) codebase.

### Why are branches used?
- To work on new features without affecting the main code.
- To fix bugs separately.
- To collaborate with others without code conflicts.
- To experiment safely without altering stable code.

### How can I make a branch?
You can create a new branch using the following command:
```bash
git branch feature-name
```
Switch to the new branch:
```bash
git checkout feature-name
```
Or combine both into one command:
```bash
git checkout -b feature-name
```

### How can I bring my branch back into the main branch?
1. Switch back to the main branch:
```bash
git checkout main
```
2. Merge the feature branch into main:
```bash
git merge feature-name
```
3. Optionally delete the feature branch:
```bash
git branch -d feature-name
```

Alternatively, if youâ€™re using GitHub or another platform, you can open a **Pull Request (PR)** to merge your branch into main via a web interface.
