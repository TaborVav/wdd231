URL STRUCTURE

The pattern for the URL is:
    baseUrl + resourcePath + parameters
Example:
    https://developer.nps.gov/api/v1/alerts?parkCode=yell&limit=10
        Resource Path: alerts
        Parameters: ?parkCode=yell&limit=10

** Parameters are separated by &, and the first parameter is preceded by ?. 
-- Truthy vs Falsy --
    Falsy values include:
        false
        null
        undefined
        0 (the number zero)
        NaN (Not-a-Number)
        "" (an empty string)
        ** ANYTHING ELSE is truthy

    EXAMPLES:
    let name = "Alice";
    let count = 0;
    let items = [];
    let user = {};

    if (name) { // "Alice" is truthy
    console.log("Name is defined.");
    }

    if (count) { // 0 is falsy, this block won't execute
    console.log("Count is not zero.");
    }

    if (items) { // [] (empty array) is truthy
    console.log("Items array exists.");
    }

    if (user) { // {} (empty object) is truthy
    console.log("User object exists.");
    }

-- How can I write Javascript code that makes decisions? --
    if statement -- Runs a block of code if a condition is true.
        let age = 18;
        if (age >= 18) {
            console.log("You are an adult.");
        }
    if...else statement: Runs one block if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
        let age = 16;
        if (age >= 18) {
            console.log("You are an adult.");
        } else {
            console.log("You are a minor.");
        }
    if...else if...else statement -- Checks multiple conditions.
        let score = 85;
        if (score >= 90) {
            console.log("A");
        } else if (score >= 80) {
            console.log("B");
        } else {
            console.log("C or lower");
        }
    switch statement -- Useful when comparing a variable against multiple values.
        let day = "Monday";
        switch (day) {
            case "Monday":
                console.log("Start of the work week!");
                break;
            case "Friday":
                console.log("Almost weekend!");
                break;
            default:
                console.log("Just another day.");
        }
    Ternary operator -- A shorthand for simple if-else statements.
        let age = 20;
        let canVote = age >= 18 ? "Yes" : "No";
        console.log(canVote); // Output: Yes

-- What are valid conditions? --
    In JavaScript, a condition is an expression that evaluates to a boolean value (true or false). Here are some common types of valid conditions:

    1. Comparison Operators:
        These operators compare two values and return true or false.

        Equality:
            == (loose equality): 5 == "5" → true
            === (strict equality): 5 === "5" → false
        Inequality:
            != (loose inequality): 5 != "5" → false
            !== (strict inequality): 5 !== "5" → true
        Greater/Less Than:
            > (greater than): 7 > 3 → true
            < (less than): 3 < 7 → true
            >= (greater than or equal to): 5 >= 5 → true
            <= (less than or equal to): 4 <= 6 → true
    2. Logical Operators:
        Used to combine multiple conditions.

        AND (&&): Both conditions must be true.
            let age = 25;
            if (age > 18 && age < 30) {
                console.log("Young adult");
            }
        OR (||): At least one condition must be true.
            let isAdmin = false;
            let isMember = true;
            if (isAdmin || isMember) {
                console.log("Access granted");
            }
        NOT (!): Inverts the condition.
            let isLoggedIn = false;
            if (!isLoggedIn) {
                console.log("Please log in");
            }
    3. Truthiness and Falsiness:
        JavaScript treats certain values as true or false in conditions.

        Falsy values:
            false, 0, "" (empty string), null, undefined, NaN
                Example:
                if (!0) { 
                    console.log("Zero is falsy"); 
                }
        Truthy values:
            Any non-falsy value, like numbers (except 0), non-empty strings, objects, and arrays.
                Example:
                if ("hello") { 
                    console.log("Non-empty strings are truthy"); 
                }
        4. Conditional Expressions:
            You can use expressions that directly evaluate to a boolean.

                let a = 10;
                if (a + 5 > 12) {
                    console.log("Condition met");
                }

-- How can I respond to events from the browser with javascript?” --
    In JavaScript, you can respond to browser events using Event Listeners. These allow your code to react when a user interacts with the page (e.g., clicking a button, typing, scrolling).

-- LIST OF EVENT LISTENERS --
    MOUSE EVENTS
        click — When the mouse button is clicked
        dblclick — Double click
        mousedown — Mouse button pressed down
        mouseup — Mouse button released
        mouseenter — Mouse pointer enters an element
        mouseleave — Mouse pointer leaves an element
        mousemove — Mouse pointer moves within an element
        mouseover — Mouse pointer moves over an element or its children
        mouseout — Mouse pointer moves out of an element or its children
        contextmenu — Right-click menu event

    KEYBOARD EVENTS
        keydown — A key is pressed down

        keypress — A key is pressed (deprecated, use keydown or keyup instead)

    FORM EVENTS
        submit — Form is submitted
        change — Value of an input/select/textarea changes and loses focus
        input — Value of an input/select/textarea changes immediately
        focus — Element gains focus
        blur — Element loses focus
        reset — Form is reset

    WINDOW/DOCUMENT EVENTS
        load — Page or resource finishes loading
        resize — Window is resized
        scroll — User scrolls the page or an element
        unload — Page is unloaded (deprecated, use beforeunload)
        beforeunload — Before the page is unloaded
        error — An error occurs during page/resource loading

    TOUCH EVENTS
        touchstart — Finger touches the screen
        touchmove — Finger moves on the screen
        touchend — Finger lifts off the screen
        touchcancel — Touch event is interrupted

    DRAG AND DROP EVENTS
        dragstart — Dragging starts
        drag — Element is being dragged
        dragenter — Dragged element enters a drop target
        dragover — Dragged element is over a drop target
        dragleave — Dragged element leaves a drop target
        drop — Dragged element is dropped on a target
        dragend — Dragging ends

    MEDIA EVENTS
        copy — User copies content
        cut — User cuts content
        paste — User pastes content

    MEDIA EVENTS
        play — Media starts playing
        pause — Media is paused
        ended — Media playback has ended
        timeupdate — Current playback position changes
        volumechange — Volume changes

-- USING EVENT LISTENERS --

    1. Adding Event Listeners
        The most common way to respond to events is using the addEventListener method.

        Basic Syntax:

        element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture);
        element: The DOM element to listen for events on.
        event: The event type (like "click", "mouseover", "keyup").
        function: The callback function to execute when the event occurs.
        useCapture: Optional. If true, uses the capturing phase; default is false (bubbling phase).
        
    2. Example Usage:
        Click Event:

        const button = document.querySelector("#myButton");
        button.addEventListener("click", () => {
            alert("Button clicked!");
        });
        Keyboard Event:

        document.addEventListener("keydown", (event) => {
            console.log(`You pressed: ${event.key}`);
        });
        Mouse Hover Event:

        const image = document.querySelector("#myImage");
        image.addEventListener("mouseover", () => {
            image.style.opacity = 0.5;
        });

    3. Removing Event Listeners:
        You can also remove an event listener using removeEventListener:

        function sayHello() {
            console.log("Hello!");
        }

        button.addEventListener("click", sayHello);
        button.removeEventListener("click", sayHello);
        Note: The function reference must match exactly, so using anonymous functions directly won't work for removal.

    4. Inline Event Handling (Not Recommended):
        You can also attach event handlers directly in HTML, but this method is outdated and less flexible.

        <button onclick="alert('Clicked!')">Click me</button>

    5. Common Events:
        Mouse Events: click, dblclick, mouseenter, mouseleave
        Keyboard Events: keydown, keyup, keypress
        Form Events: submit, change, focus, blur
        Window Events: load, resize, scroll
